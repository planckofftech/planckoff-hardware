## The Big Picture — Layered Architecture

Think of the app like an onion. Each layer only talks to the layer directly below it. No layer skips over another.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  PRESENTATION LAYER                          │
│  components/, views/                         │
│  What the user sees and interacts with       │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  APPLICATION LAYER                           │
│  services/, hooks/                           │
│  Business logic, AI calls, pricing math      │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  INFRASTRUCTURE LAYER                        │
│  app/api/ (Next.js API Routes)               │
│  API proxy, auth middleware, DB queries      │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  DATA LAYER                                  │
│  Supabase PostgreSQL + Storage               │
│  The actual data store                       │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Why enforce this?**
- If a UI component calls Supabase directly, you can't test the component in isolation
- If a component calls the AI directly, the API key is exposed in the browser
- Layers let you swap out the database or AI provider without touching the UI

## Why These Technologies?

---

### Why Next.js instead of plain React + Vite?

The old codebase was React + Vite. We migrated to Next.js for three critical reasons:

1. **API Routes** — Next.js gives us server-side routes (`app/api/`). This is how we keep the Gemini API key on the server and never expose it to the browser. With plain Vite, you'd need a separate Express server.

2. **Server-Side Rendering** — The dashboard and project list can be rendered on the server, which makes the first paint faster.

3. **App Router** — Cleaner file-based routing, layouts that persist across pages (so the sidebar doesn't re-render on every navigation).

**Trade-off:** Next.js adds more complexity than Vite. Cold starts are slower. But for a SaaS with API key security requirements, it's worth it.

### Why Supabase instead of MongoDB?

| Reason | Supabase (PostgreSQL) | MongoDB |
|---|---|---|
| **Data shape** | Doors and hardware have fixed schemas with known fields | Better for truly flexible/unknown schemas |
| **Relationships** | A door belongs to a project, a hardware set has many items — relational fits perfectly | Embedding everything in one document can work but gets messy |
| **Row Level Security (RLS)** | Built-in at the DB level — one company CANNOT see another's data, enforced in Postgres | Would need application-level enforcement (more risk) |
| **Auth + Storage** | Supabase gives you auth, file storage, and a DB in one product | MongoDB Atlas doesn't include auth or file storage out of the box |
| **JSON support** | PostgreSQL has excellent JSONB columns when you need flexibility | Native |
| **Free tier** | Generous free tier for a startup/MVP | Atlas free tier has stricter limits |
| **Open source** | Can self-host Supabase | MongoDB has open-source version but Atlas is cloud-only |

**The short answer:** Our data is fundamentally relational — projects have doors, doors have hardware sets, hardware sets have items. PostgreSQL is the natural fit. We also needed Row Level Security for multi-tenancy, and Supabase gives us that built in.

---

### Why JSONB Instead of Fully Normalized Tables?

We actually use **both** — relational tables for structure AND JSONB for flexibility.

**Where we use JSONB:**
- `projects` table stores doors as a JSONB blob (`doors jsonb`) instead of a separate normalized table
- This was the MVP approach: ship fast, validate the data model, normalize later
- Migration 004 (`004_relational_hardware_schema.sql`) started moving toward normalized tables for hardware

**Why JSONB specifically?**
- Postgres JSONB is indexed, queryable, and validated
- You can run `WHERE data->>'fireRating' = '1 HR'` directly in SQL
- It compresses well and stores binary (faster than plain `json` column)

**When is JSON the right choice?**
- When the shape of the data changes frequently (we were still discovering what fields doors needed)
- When you need to store the full object for export or AI input without extra joins
- When you want to avoid premature schema normalization before you know all requirements

**When should you normalize?**
- When you need to query individual fields frequently at scale
- When you need foreign key constraints and data integrity
- When multiple tables need to reference the same record

**Our current situation:** We store pricing, sections, and hardware specs as JSONB inside the door record. This was intentional — a door has 50+ possible fields and many are optional. Normalizing all of that into separate tables would have slowed down early development. The trade-off is that reporting/querying is harder.

---

### Why Web Workers?

PDF parsing of a 200-page file is CPU-intensive. If you do this on the main JavaScript thread:
- The browser UI **freezes** — buttons don't respond, no progress updates
- Users think the app is broken and close the tab

Web Workers run JavaScript on a **separate thread**. The main thread stays responsive, shows a progress bar, lets users navigate away, and receives results when the worker is done.

```
Main Thread (UI)          Worker Thread (background)
────────────────          ───────────────────────────
Show progress bar   ←─── postMessage({ progress: 45 })
User can click X    ←─── postMessage({ progress: 70 })
Receive results     ←─── postMessage({ done: true, doors: [...] })
```

**Trade-off:** Workers can't access the DOM or any browser APIs directly. Communication is message-passing only. IndexedDB is used for task persistence so if the user refreshes the page, uploads can resume.

---

### Why TypeScript?

A hardware spec object has 50+ fields. Without TypeScript:
- You don't know if `door.fireRating` is a string, number, or undefined
- Refactoring breaks things you didn't know were connected
- AI-generated code suggestions are less accurate

With TypeScript:
- The IDE tells you exactly what fields a `Door` has
- You can't pass a `HardwareSet` where a `HardwareItem` is expected
- Refactors are safe — the compiler catches all the breakages

**Rule in this project:** No `any`. Use `unknown` + type guards. This is strictly enforced.

---

### Why CSS Custom Properties for dark mode instead of Tailwind's built-in `dark:` prefix?

Tailwind's `dark:bg-white` approach requires duplicating every color class. When you have 50+ components, that's `dark:bg-gray-900 bg-white dark:text-gray-100 text-gray-900` everywhere.

Instead, we define tokens:
```css
:root {
  --bg: #ffffff;
  --text: #0f172a;
  --border: #e2e8f0;
}

.dark {
  --bg: #0f172a;
  --text: #f8fafc;
  --border: #1e293b;
}
```

Then every component just writes `bg-[var(--bg)] text-[var(--text)]`. Flip the `.dark` class, every component updates automatically. One place to change the whole theme.

## Database Schema — Key Tables

### Migration History (What was built when)

| Migration | What It Created |
|---|---|
| 001 | `admins`, `team_members`, `auth_sessions` tables |
| 002 | `projects` table (stores doors as JSONB) |
| 003 | Location lookup data |
| 004 | `hardware_items`, `hardware_sets` — normalized hardware tables |
| 005 | `elevation_images` — Supabase Storage integration |
| 006 | Fixed RLS policies for elevations |
| 007 | `project_elevation_types` junction table |
| 008 | `master_hardware_items` — global inventory |
| 009 | `hardware_trash` — soft delete support |
| 010 | Fixed uniqueness constraints on master hardware |

### Core Tables

```sql
-- Teams / Auth
admins (id, email, password_hash, name, created_at)
team_members (id, admin_id, email, name, role, invited_at, joined_at)
auth_sessions (id, user_id, user_type, expires_at, created_at)

-- Projects (JSONB approach)
projects (
  id, admin_id, name, client, location, status,
  doors jsonb,          -- array of Door objects
  hardware_sets jsonb,  -- array of HardwareSet objects
  elevation_types jsonb,
  created_at, updated_at, deleted_at
)

-- Normalized Hardware (migration 004+)
hardware_sets (id, project_id, name, description, division)
hardware_items (id, set_id, name, quantity, manufacturer, finish, unit_price, ...)

-- Elevations (Supabase Storage)
elevation_images (id, project_id, name, storage_path, image_url, created_at)

-- Global Inventory
master_hardware_items (id, admin_id, name, manufacturer, category, unit_price, ...)
hardware_trash (id, admin_id, item_data jsonb, deleted_at)
```

### Row Level Security (RLS) — Multi-tenancy Enforcement

Every table has RLS policies. For example:
```sql
-- A team member can only see projects belonging to their admin
CREATE POLICY "team_can_view_projects" ON projects
  FOR SELECT USING (
    admin_id = (
      SELECT admin_id FROM team_members 
      WHERE id = auth.uid()
    )
    OR admin_id = auth.uid()
  );
```

This means even if someone guesses another project's UUID, Postgres will return zero rows. The security is at the data level, not just the application level.

---

## Auth Flow

The app uses custom session-based auth (not Supabase Auth — a deliberate choice for more control).

```
1. User submits login form
   ↓
2. POST /api/auth/login
   ↓
3. Server looks up user in admins or team_members table
4. bcrypt.compare(password, stored_hash)  ← password never stored plain
   ↓
5. If valid: create row in auth_sessions (token, expires_at)
6. Set HttpOnly cookie with session token
   ↓
7. Every subsequent request:
   middleware.ts reads cookie → validates session → attaches user to request
   ↓
8. API routes use withAuth() helper to check session before proceeding
```

**Why HttpOnly cookies?**
- The cookie is invisible to JavaScript (`document.cookie` can't read it)
- Prevents XSS attacks from stealing the session token
- Automatically sent with every request

**Why custom session auth instead of Supabase Auth?**
- More control over session management
- Can store additional fields (role, admin_id) in the session
- Supabase Auth is OAuth-focused; we needed email+password for an internal tool

---

## State Management

| State | Where It Lives | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Auth (logged-in user) | `AuthContext` + cookie | Needs to be global, verified server-side |
| Projects + Doors + Hardware | `ProjectContext` | ~1000 lines, being split into smaller contexts |
| Toast notifications | `ToastContext` | Lightweight, fire-and-forget UI state |
| Background upload tasks | `BackgroundUploadContext` | Tracks active Web Worker jobs with progress |
| Processing widget | `ProcessingWidgetContext` | Shows/hides the floating progress widget |

**Why React Context instead of Redux?**
- This is a focused domain app, not a massive social media platform
- Context is simpler, less boilerplate, and sufficient for this scale
- Redux would add `actions`, `reducers`, `selectors`, `middleware` — too much ceremony
- Trade-off: Context re-renders all consumers when any value changes; we mitigate by splitting contexts

**Current problem:** `ProjectContext.tsx` is ~1000 lines with too much mixed state. It should be split into `ProjectListContext`, `ActiveProjectContext`, `HardwareContext`.

## API Route Patterns

All Next.js API routes follow the same pattern:

```typescript
// app/api/projects/route.ts
export async function GET(request: NextRequest) {
  // 1. Authenticate
  const { user, error } = await withAuth(request);
  if (error) return NextResponse.json({ error }, { status: 401 });

  // 2. Query database (scoped to user's admin_id)
  const projects = await getProjectsByAdmin(user.adminId);

  // 3. Return response
  return NextResponse.json({ projects });
}

export async function POST(request: NextRequest) {
  const { user, error } = await withAuth(request);
  if (error) return NextResponse.json({ error }, { status: 401 });

  const body = await request.json() as NewProjectData;
  const project = await createProject(user.adminId, body);

  return NextResponse.json({ project }, { status: 201 });
}
```
